Basic HTTP/Web honeypot for embedded systems (openwrt, mobiles, ...)
Copyright (C) Kost. Distributed under GPL. 

This is really basic http/web honeypot which answers randomly to 
different web requests. It logs all packets to custom log file or 
syslog.

Since it is very small it is good honeypot for embedded systems:
OpenWRT, Android, iPhone, etc.

It is advised to edit the requests & responses which will suit 
your need.

Some parts were reused from nweb.
